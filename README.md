### Project part 1/3 library. CNN for analysis of live-cell-painting time-series.
this repository contains the DL-sourcecode for the live-cell-painting data.  
It will contain at least three sepparate systems; one for spoofing data, one for analysing data, and one for tracking data.  
the project aims to use full-image tracking for now, though this may end up changing.
